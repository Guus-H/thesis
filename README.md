Queries, scripts and routines of Master's thesis Guus Hutschemaekers on the technological and geographical origins of innovation

The files defining functions are in the corresponding directory.
The files in the root call upon these functions.
In the script files as well as the function files, there are many undocumented lines of code.
If any of the scripts are unclear feel free to contact me, I'm happy you help you where I can, just send me an email:
